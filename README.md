# Smart_restaurant_billing_system
I have Developed this GUI Application using Python and it's Tikinter library to add Frames and Graphical user Interface to the application.
its database storage works on the Sql database management system. 
it has two db files records.db to store costomer details and food.db to store the details of food.
this gui application is fully functional and can used for bill generation and storing food and coustomer details.
