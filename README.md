# Smart_restaurant_billing_system
I have Developed this GUI Application using Python and it's Tikinter library to add Frames and Graphical user Interface to the application.
its database storage works on the Sql database management system. 
it has two db files records.db to store customers details and food.db to store the details of food.
You can also add or remove foods from the record. But the customers Records can't be modified. 
To run this Application you do not need any compiler Or interpreter it will run directly when you will click on Python Project.py file. 
To use this application you have to login Or create your account on that using your email id, without login you cannot use the application
this gui application is fully functional and can used for bill generation and storing food and coustomer details.
